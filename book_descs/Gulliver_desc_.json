"There is an air of truth\napparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished\nfor the author veracity, that the author became a sort of proverb among the author neighbours\nat Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if\nMr. Gulliver had spoken it. This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made\nbold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and\ntides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several\nvoyages, together with the minute descriptions of the management of the\nship in storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of\nlongitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend, that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied."
